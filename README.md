# Automated Document Extraction & Standardization System - Assignment 1

### Overview

This project explores the feasibility of using open-source and enterprise tools for extracting, processing, and standardizing unstructured data from PDFs and web pages. The goal is to develop a prototype AI application that automates data extraction, converts content into a structured Markdown format, and organizes files efficiently in an Amazon S3 storage system.

The project evaluates the trade-offs between open-source libraries like PyMuPDF, and BeautifulSoup versus an enterprise-grade service like Adobe PDF Services, comparing their performance, accuracy, and scalability. The extracted content is standardized using Docling and MarkItDown, with a comparison of their suitability for Markdown conversion.

A full pipeline is implemented, consisting of:-

Data Extraction: Parsing PDFs and scraping web pages

Content Standardization: Formatting extracted text with Markdown

Cloud Storage: Organizing processed files in an S3 bucket

API Development: Providing endpoints via FastAPI

User Interface: A web-based interface built using Streamlit

### Key Features
1. Data Extraction & Processing

PDF Parsing:
Open-source: PyMuPDF,
Enterprise: Adobe Services

Web Scraping:
Open-source: BeautifulSoup,
Enterprise: Apify

Comparison: Evaluation of tool accuracy, text quality, table/image preservation, and scalability

2. Standardization & Markdown Conversion
   
Docling: Specialized for structured linguistic processing

MarkItDown: More flexible for generic Markdown formatting

Comparison: Pros/cons of both approaches in content structuring and integration

3. File Organization & Storage (S3)
   
bigdatasystems(Bucket name)/pdf name/parser name/markdown file

bigdatasystems(Bucket name)/pdf name/parser name/image folder/markdown file

bigdatasystems(Bucket name)/pdf name/parser name/table folder/markdown file

4. API Development with FastAPI
   
/backend_fastapi/routes/fetch.py → defines a FastAPI endpoint that retrieves and returns the contents of a parsed file such as PDF or Web page from an Amazon S3 bucket. Fetches parsed markdown content from specific locations in an S3 bucket, with the location determined by the filename and the type of parser used.

/backend_fastapi/routes/upload.py → defines two FastAPI endpoints for processing and uploading PDF files and webpages.

/pdf endpoint: Accepts a PDF file upload and a parser type. Based on the parser type ("Open Source" or "Enterprise"), it processes the PDF using different functions. It uploads the processed content to an S3 bucket and returns a success message with the S3 file path.
 
/backend_fastapi/main.py → handles PDF uploads, parsing, and fetching of parsed Markdown files from S3

The structure contains:

The /upload endpoints handle PDF uploads and processing

The /fetch endpoints retrieve parsed content

This setup provides a clear organization for the API's functionality, separating upload and fetch operations into distinct modules

5. Web Interface with Streamlit
    
User uploads PDFs or inputs webpage URLs.

API triggers processing pipeline.

Processed Markdown files can be downloaded.

Deployed on Amazon Web Services for accessibility.

6. Evaluation & Findings
    
The project documents a detailed comparison between open-source tools and enterprise solutions, highlighting factors such as:
1. Accuracy of text, table, and image extraction
2. Ease of integration into a larger pipeline
3. Cost-effectiveness and scalability for enterprise use

### Proof of Concept (PoC):
This Proof of Concept (PoC) aims to validate the feasibility of automating document processing and standardization using AI-driven tools. The objective is to extract, process, and structure unstructured data from PDFs and web pages, converting them into a standardized Markdown format, and storing the processed content efficiently in an Amazon S3 storage system. The project evaluates open-source and enterprise-grade tools for data extraction, content transformation, and storage management.

### Key Findings

Open-source solutions provide cost-effectiveness but require additional optimizations for accuracy and scalability.

Enterprise solutions offer higher accuracy and better integration but may have licensing costs.

For PDF extraction, Adobe PDF Services outperforms PyMuPDF in table and image extraction accuracy.

For web scraping, Apify provides a scalable, structured solution compared to BeautifulSoup.

Docling is useful for structured text, while MarkItDown is more flexible for general Markdown conversion.

A structured file organization strategy in S3 ensures efficient storage and retrieval of processed documents.

### Conclusion & Next Steps

Enhance Open-source Solutions: Improve Apify and BeautifulSoup integration for better text and table extraction.

Optimize Pipeline Efficiency: Automate metadata tagging and processing using AI-based classification.

Deploy Prototype for Testing: Implement in a real-world environment and gather user feedback.
Evaluate Cost-Effectiveness: Assess long-term costs of enterprise tools versus enhanced open-source solutions.

This PoC demonstrates the viability of an AI-powered document processing pipeline and provides a foundation for scaling the solution in enterprise applications.
